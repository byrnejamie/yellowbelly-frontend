# YellowBelly Brand Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

- **Friendly and approachable** - like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporation
- **Confident but not boastful** - we know our stuff, no need to shout about it
- **Clear and jargon-free** - our audience values their time, get to the point
- **Helpful** - we want you to succeed, not just buy

### Do
- Use "we" (company voice)
- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- Be direct and concise
- Acknowledge real pain points

### Don't
- Use hype or superlatives ("best ever", "revolutionary")
- Pressure tactics or false urgency
- Corporate speak or buzzwords
- Talk down to the reader

## Core Promise

YellowBelly plugins are:

1. **Reliable** - They just work. Maintained for years, not abandoned after launch.
2. **Simple** - No bloat, no feature creep. Does one thing well.
3. **Performant** - Lightweight code that won't slow your site down.

## Audience

### Primary
- **Solo WordPress developers** - building their own sites, want tools that work without fuss
- **Freelance web developers** - building sites for clients, need reliable tools they can trust

### Secondary
- **Agencies** - welcome, but not our primary target

### Audience Mindset
- Time-poor, want solutions not projects
- Burned by bloated or abandoned plugins before
- Value quality over quantity
- Willing to pay for tools that save headaches

## Messaging Principles

1. **Lead with benefits, not features** - "Your site stays fast" not "Optimized database queries"
2. **Acknowledge the pain** - We know the plugin ecosystem has problems
3. **Show, don't tell** - Specifics beat vague claims
4. **Respect intelligence** - Our audience knows WordPress, don't oversimplify

## Background Credibility

Use sparingly - let the work speak for itself:

- 20 years of development experience behind the scenes
- Built by developers who use these tools daily
- Not chasing trends - pragmatic, proven tech choices
- We've seen frameworks come and go; we build what lasts

## Keywords Bank (Baseline)

Core terms:
- wordpress plugins
- premium wordpress plugins

Expand per page using the SEO researcher skill.
